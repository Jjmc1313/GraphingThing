# Graphing Tool
It's a really basic graphing tool. Runs really poorly but was kind of fun to make. 

## Usage
- Input # of expressions
- Input expressions (as a function of x)
- Use arrow keys to pan the viewport around
- = / - for zoom (zooms in about the origin of the graph, not the centerpoint)
- 0 to reset graph

## Dependency
(exp4j)[https://www.objecthunter.net/exp4j/] - I think I'll eventually make my own implementation of this cus it seems like a fun challenge
